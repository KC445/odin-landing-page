# odin-landing-page


This is the second project I have completed as part of the Odin Project course.  The site is a landing page for a Film Noir movie recommendation site.  While we were given a general framework for the layout of the site, the design was still one of the hardest aspects for me.  I didn't want to just copy the colors, fonts, and text of the sample page, so I wanted to come up with something based on one of my interests.  I have a feeling designing the layout and content of sites will be the hardest part for me going thru this course, but I'm looking forward to the challenge.

As far as the HTML and CSS for the project, I feel that went smoothly.  I know there are probably several spots that can be improved, but the site looks and functions how it is supposed to.  One thing I noticed too late was that my CSS needs to be more organized, rather than just adding things when I need them (kind of got hard to find selectors).  There are also probably spots where I can combine selectors rather than adding the same style properties multiple times.
